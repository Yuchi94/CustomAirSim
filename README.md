# Multi-Agent Autonomous Vehicle Navigation at Intersections with Deep Reinforcement Learning

AirSim is a realistic drone and automobile simulator from Microsoft, built on top of the Unreal Engine. At the time of this project, AirSim did not support multiple agents for automobiles. This project looks into modifying the AirSim plugin to enable multiple agents and using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) to train multiple agents to simultaneously navigate a 4-way intersection. States into the network are the past 5 frames of the front view and the action space is continuous for both the steering and acceleration. Checkout the learnt policy below below!

# Welcome to AirSim

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more built on Unreal Engine. It is open-source, cross platform and supports hardware-in-loop with popular flight controllers such as PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped in to any Unreal environment you want.

Our goal is to develop AirSim as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, AirSim also exposes APIs to retrieve data and control vehicles in a platform independent way.

## How to Get It

### Windows
* [Download binaries](docs/use_precompiled.md)
* [Build it](docs/build_windows.md)

### Linux
* [Build it](docs/build_linux.md)

## How to Use It

### Choosing Your Vehicle: Car or Multirotor
By default AirSim spawns multirotor. You can easily change this to car and use all of AirSim goodies. Please see [using car](docs/using_car.md) guide.

### Manual drive

If you have remote control (RC) as shown below, you can manually control the drone in the simulator. For cars, you can use arrow keys to drive manually.

[More details](docs/remote_control.md)

### Programmatic control

AirSim exposes APIs so you can interact with vehicle in the simulation programmatically. You can use these APIs to retrieve images, get state, control the vehicle and so on. The APIs are exposed through RPC and accessible via variety of languages including C++, Python, C# and Java.

These APIs are also available as a part of a separate independent cross-platform library so you can deploy them on an companion computer on your vehicle. This way you can write and test your code in simulator and later execute it on the real vehicles. Transfer learning and related research is one of our focus areas.

[More details](docs/apis.md)

### Gathering training data

There are two ways you can generate training data from AirSim for deep learning. The easiest way is to simply press the record button on the lower right corner. This will start writing pose and images for each frame. The data logging code is pretty simple and you can modify it to your heart's desire.

A better way to generate training data exactly the way you want is by accessing the APIs. This allows you to be in full control of how, what, where and when you want to log data. 

### Computer Vision mode

Yet another way to use AirSim is so-called "Computer Vision" mode. In this mode, you don't have vehicle physics and dynamics but you can use keyboard to move around and use APIs to position the vehicle in any arbitrary pose and get images such as depth, disparity, surface normals or object segmentation.

## What's New

* We now have the [car model](docs/using_car.md).
* No need to build the code. Just download [binaries](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases) and you are good to go!
* The [reinforcement learning example](docs/reinforcement_learning.md) with AirSim
* New built-in flight controller called [simple_flight](docs/simple_flight.md) that "just works" without any additional setup. It is also now *default*. 
* AirSim now also generates [depth as well as disparity images](docs/image_apis.md) that is in camera plan. 
* We also have official Linux build now! If you have been using AirSim with PX4, you might want to read the [release notes](docs/release_notes.md).
